# My own brew tap
---
This repo contains brew recipies that I use in other projects. I just need to have it somewhere.

To use it, first install Homebrew:
```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```
Then you need to add this tap
```
$ brew tap vetlewi/formula
```
Then you can start installing stuff!
